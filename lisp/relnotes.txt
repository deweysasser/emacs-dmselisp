			       Summary

This release of the elisp documentation tools has several new features
and some bug fixes (yet again).  The new features are not yet
document.  

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> New Features <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

o added "align-regexp" package

o added an "idl-mode" and added entry to auto-mode-alist so that it is
  used for *.idl

o added ispell-comments and ispell-strings.  ispell-comments has
  problems with languages that use begin and end comment characters
  (like 'C') because of some oddness (or rather lack of functionality)
  in emacs syntax understanding.

o Added pure-mode to auto-mode-alist for .plog files.  Pure mode is
  *not* supplied with this package (get Rick's latest)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Bug Fixes <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

o No longer changes the kill ring when a file is saved

o no longer internally loads "c-mode", messing up post-19.30 Emacen

o AutoProto no longer chops up #endif

o document-function in c-mode no longer leaves an extra "*/"

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Known Bugs <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

o ispell-comments (see "New Packages")

o pure.el not included
