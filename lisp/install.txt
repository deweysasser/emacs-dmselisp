1) copy the files from the disk to a place on your lisp path

2) Load the file "nvscomp.el" into a buffer, then type "M-x
   eval-buffer" (or M-x eval-current-buffer in emacs 18.xx) 

   run the command compile-nvs (M-x compile-nvs)

3) put the following line in your .emacs file.  Make sure this line
   ocurrs AFTER any line which puts the elisp directory on your load
   path: 
   (require 'nvs)

Have Fun!
