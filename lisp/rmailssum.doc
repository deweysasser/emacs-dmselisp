package that maintains a cross reference database.

Use Case:

M-x rmailssum [RET] SEMICON

should show a rmail-summary type buffer that allows you to the same functionality as rmail-summary with messges that reference "SEMICON".  

The generator should take a synonym list so that
"NVS" and "New Vision Systems" are the same thing.

This system should automatically add messages as they come in and are filed, deleted, etc.

It should also allow renaming of a file, manually.
