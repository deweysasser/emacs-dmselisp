        * For some reason, can't recompile eltest.el if it's alread
	loaded.  This needs to be fixed

        * elprof.el: master function doesn't work.  Recursion elimination
	is a bit hard on CLOS.

	* header.el: find next function summary (in TOC) doesn't work
	  correctly when in emacs lisp mode.  It finds the synopsis.

	* c-suppor.el: Add a way to skip white space when getting the
	  next function beginning line.  Also, turn this into a
	  separate function if it isn't already so that it can be used
	  for prototyping.
